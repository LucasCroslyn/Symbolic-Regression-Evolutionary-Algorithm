# Symbolic-Regression-Evolutionary-Algorithm

This project was doing a Symbolic Regression Tree and a Classification Tree using evolutionary algorithms.

- The main file that shows the algorithms running is in the main.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
- The SymRegFunctions.py file contains the functions for the Symbolic Regression Tree Genetic Algorithm.
- The TypedFunctions.py file contains the functions for the Classification Tree Genetic Algorithm (called TypedFunctions because the nodes for the Tree have pre-defined types).
- The CommonFunctions.py file contains functions that are the exact same and are used between both SymRegFunctions.py and TypedFunctions.py
- The datasets used for the projects are the .csv files (d1-7.csv are for Symbolic Regression, iris.csv is for the classification).
- The images used for a writeup (only the Symbolic Regression data, the classification only got working after the writeup was done) are displayed below.
